Agri-Sense
Agri-Sense is a web application designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about their farming strategies. The application provides recommendations on crop selection, fertilizer usage, and disease identification based on user inputs and machine learning models.

Features
Crop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crops to grow based on soil conditions and environmental factors.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Provides tailored fertilizer advice based on soil nutrient levels.
Disease Prediction: Identifies potential diseases affecting crops through image uploads and provides suggestions for treatment.
User -Friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate web interface for seamless user experience.
Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (Python)
Machine Learning: PyTorch, Scikit-learn
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Database: Not specified (assumed to be in-memory or file-based for this project)
