🌾 Agri-Sense – Smart Farming Assistant
Agri-Sense is an intelligent web application designed to empower farmers with data-driven insights for improved agricultural practices. By integrating machine learning, the platform offers real-time recommendations on crop selection, fertilizer usage, and disease detection, thereby enhancing productivity and sustainability.

🚀 Features
🌱 Crop Recommendation
Get intelligent crop suggestions based on soil parameters and environmental conditions.

🧪 Fertilizer Guidance
Receive customized fertilizer recommendations based on nutrient levels (NPK values) to optimize yield.

🦠 Disease Prediction
Upload images of crops to detect diseases and get treatment advice using deep learning models.

🖥️ Clean User Interface
Intuitive and responsive interface to ensure seamless interaction for users of all technical backgrounds.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend
Framework: Flask (Python)

ML Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

Frontend
Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript

Others
API Integration: Weather API (configurable in config.py)

Database: (Not specified; assumed to be local/in-memory for now)

💡 Usage Guide
Crop Recommendation:
Enter soil details such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, and rainfall to get suitable crop suggestions.

Fertilizer Recommendation:
Provide soil NPK levels to get fertilizer usage advice.

Disease Detection:
Upload a leaf image; the system predicts the disease (if any) and offers treatment suggestions.
